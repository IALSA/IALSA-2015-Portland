These files became obsolete when Andrea Zammit uploaded the new files for Grip on 2016-11-11 (commit: https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/commit/af7397046d0105d3d93d7959d214c5b650b88183)

The new files are placed in `./studies/eas/physical-cognitive/without-errors/grip-2016-11-11`

I have removed 22 "aehplus" models from `./studies/eas/physical-cognitive/without-errors/Grip Output Files` and moved it to `./studies/eas/physical-cognitive/obsolete-duplicates/grip` (commit: https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/commit/5ec8545e37dd94731ee4b44c1646e97681914e86)
