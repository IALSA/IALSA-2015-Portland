Physical functioning

Pulmonary function: This was calculated by having the participant blowing as hard and as fast as possible into a peak flow meter; the best out of three trials was used for analysis.

Muscle strength: Grip strength: Maximum grip strength was measured three times on the participant’s dominant hand using a grip dynamometer; the best of three trials was used for analysis.

Walking speed: Gait variables were collected using a 12-foot instrumented walkway (180 × 35.5 × 0.25 inches) with embedded pressure sensors (GAITRite, CIR systems, Havertown, PA). Participants were asked to walk on the mat in a well-lit hallway at their normal walking speed two times. Start and stop points were marked by white lines and included a three foot distance each for initial acceleration and terminal deceleration. Monitoring devices were not attached to the participants during the test. Gait velocity (cm/second) was computed by the software as dividing the distance covered on two trials by the ambulation time. Excellent reliability and validity for GAITRite assessments were reported in previous research in our center (Verghese et al., 2002) and in other studies (Bilney, Morris, & Webster, 2003).
