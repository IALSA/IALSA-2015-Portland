     WARNING: THE MODEL ESTIMATION HAS REACHED A SADDLE POINT OR A POINT WHERE THE
     OBSERVED AND THE EXPECTED INFORMATION MATRICES DO NOT MATCH.
     AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE ESTIMATION OF THE INFORMATION MATRIX HAS BEEN MADE.
     THE CONDITION NUMBER IS      -0.885D-04.
     THE PROBLEM MAY ALSO BE RESOLVED BY DECREASING THE VALUE OF THE
