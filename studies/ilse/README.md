How to work with this GitHub folder
---

Use **unshared** folder to place your data and run your analyses. The content of the **unshared** folder will not be uploaded.

Name your models to fit the common naming convention. This is a key step in organizing aggregation of model results across studies.

After fitting the models , place the output files in the root folder of your study (eg. /octo, /radc, ect). Only the models that have legal names and that have been placed in the proper folder will be added to the pan-study analysis.

## Please implement the corrections

1. The instead of "t3", adhear to the example in the template: "time3". Please re-run your models with the proper naming convention
