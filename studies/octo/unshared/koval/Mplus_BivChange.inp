TITLE: Bivariate Latent Growth Model;!Title to help you differentiate one input/output from another

DATA:  FILE IS BivChange.dat; !Name of data file and where data is located (if not in same location as input file

VARIABLE: Names are y1-y5 x1-x5 time1-time5 age; !All variables in data set kept in same order
    
MISSING is all(-9999); !Value used for missing cases 
      
USEVAR are ; !Variables used in analysis. New variables in DEFINE must be included
 
USEOBSERVATIONS are y1-y5 x1-x5 time1-time5 age80;!To select observations (e.g. exclude individuals with dementia)

TSCORES= time1-time5;!For individually varying times of observation 

Define: age80 = age - 80; !To define new variables e.g. to centre variables and ;        

ANALYSIS: ESTIMATOR = MLR; TYPE = RANDOM; !Type of analysis requested

MODEL:  i s| y1-y5 AT time1-time5;!Univariate growth model
        i2 s2| x1-x5 AT time1-time5;!Univariate growth model
        i s i2 s2;!Variances
        i s i2 s2 WITH i s i2 s2; !Covariances between latent variables. Default in Mplus 
    	i i2 ON age80; !Control for covariates on intercept and slope
        s s2 ON age80; !Control for covariates on intercept and slope
          	
        y1-y5 pwith x1-x5(WP); !Paired covariances constrained to be equal across time
        y1-y5(1); !Residual Variances constrained to be equal across time
