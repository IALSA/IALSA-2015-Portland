Study_Name contained the following measures, as described by the study's documentation. [text](http://)


##Grip

**grip** -  The participants’ grip strength was measured by a hand grip dynamometer by a trained research nurse at the IPT. The participant made six attempts (three with each hand) and the maximum score (in kg) was considered as the participant’s grip strength score.

##Gait

**gait** - Walking speed time. Time to walk 3 meters and return was recorded starting at IPT2. The nurse administering the interview used a stopwatch to measure the amount of time it took (in seconds) for the participant to complete this task

##Pulmonary

**pef** - Spirometric testing was performed during in-person testing on one of two intercalibrated portable 10-1 dry bellows Vicatest spirometers (Mijnhardt, Bunnik, The Netherlands) with subjects in the seated position and their nasal passages blocked with nose clips. Forced expiratory volume during the first second (FEV1) was collected. During the course of the study, it became necessary to change spirometric equipment due to the increasing difficulty of transporting the Vicatest spirometers and the availability of new spirometric equipment that was lighter and easier for the nurses to use. Thus, at IPT3, pulmonary function for 30% of the subjects was measured using the Vicatest, and the remaining subjects were assessed with a portable ML 330 spirometer (Micor Medical, Kent, United Kingdom). The two spirometers were intercalibrated to ensure consistent measurement. FEV1 values for both spirometers were expressed in BTPS (body temperature and pressure saturated with water vapor).

##Other gait

**chair** - Chair rise time. Time to complete five chair stands is an index of lower body strength and was measured by asking participants to sit in a chair, cross their arms at their chest, and stand up from the chair five times as quickly as possible without using their arms for assistance. Starting with IPT2, the nurse administering the interview used a stopwatch to measure the amount of time it took (in seconds) for the participant to complete this task.
