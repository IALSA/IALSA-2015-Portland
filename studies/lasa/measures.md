Study_Name contained the following measures, as described by the study's documentation. [text](http://)


##Grip

**grip** - Grip strength was measured using a strain-gauged dynamometer which was adjusted to each participant’s hand (Takei TKK 5001; Takei Scientific Instruments Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Two measurements of strength to the nearest 1 kg were taken from the right and left hand. For the purpose of these analyses, the total grip strength score was measured as the sum of the maximum strength value of the left and right hand divided by two (We could also have used the maximum strength out of two attempts of the dominant hand. Something to look into since we are combining data from numerous studies). Grip strength data is available at wave C, D, E, F, G, H.

##Peak expiratory flow 

**PEF** - PEF (person’s maximum speed of expiration) was measured using the Mini-Wright peak flow meter. Participants were asked to take a maximum inspiration and to breathe out with maximum effort into the peak flow meter. This was repeated three times and the highest score was used in the analyses. PEF data is available at wave B, C, D, E, G, H.

##Walking Test

**Walking Test** - For the walking test, participants were instructed to walk three meters, turn around and walk back three meters as quickly as possible. The time taken to accomplish the task was recorded in seconds. Walking Test data is available at wave B, C, D, E, F, G, H. 

##Chair Stands Test

**Chair Stands Test** -  For the Chair Stands Test, participants were instructed to stand up from a sitting position and sit down five times as quickly as possible with their arms folded across their chest. The time taken to accomplish the five chair stands was recorded and used as a measure of lower extremities functioning. Chair Stands Test data is available at wave B, C, D, E, F, G, H. 

##Cardigan Test

**Cardigan Test** - For the Cardigan Test, participants are instructed to put on and take off a cardigan as quickly as possible. Time taken to complete the task is recorded and used as a measure of the functioning of the upper extremities. Cardigan Test data is available at wave B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

##Standing Balance

**Standing Balance** - For the standing balance test, participants are instructed to keep their feet in the tandem position for 10 seconds. The standing balance test is categoriesd as unable = 0, able to hold position for 3-9 seconds = 2, and able to hold position for 10 seconds = 4. Standing Balance data is available at wave C, D, E, F, G, H.
