How to work with this GitHub folder
---

1. Select the folder that matches your study

2. Create a folder named with your last name inside  **unshared** , all lower case letters. The contents of this folder will not be uploaded.

3. Name your models to fit the common naming convention. This is a key step in organizing aggregation of model results across studies.

3. After fitting the models , place the output files in the root folder of your study (eg. /octo, /radc, ect). Only the models that have legal names and that have been placed in the proper folder will be added to the pan-study analysis.
