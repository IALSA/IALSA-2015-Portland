These files are the modern versions of their counterpart, which became obsolete when Valerie Jarry uploaded the new files for Grip on 2016-11-11 (commit: https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/commit/e79b9c8d470b81a13ccf9722640f8529f6890d97)

The new files are placed in `./studies/nuage/physical-cognitive/without-errors/grip-2016-11-11`

I have removed 4 "aehplus" models from `./studies/nuage/physical-cognitive/without-errors/` and moved it to `./studies/nuage/physical-cognitive/obsolete-duplicates/grip` (https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/commit/f0a9a5e42d2598eeb13450c7b283f92ba993e5ff)
