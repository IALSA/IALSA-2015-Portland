##Grip

**grip** -  
Grip strength was measured in KPa using a pneumatic dynamometer (Martin Vigorimeter). Three maximal contractions were recorded on both the dominant and the opposite side (Choquette et al. 2010). Our value of grip strength is the average of the best scores of each hand. Grip strength measure was conducted at time 1-2-3 and 4.

##Measure2 - Gait speed
Gait speed at normal pace was measured by recording the time participants took to walk twice at their usual pace over a 4 meter course. The fastest time of the two trials was kept. Gait speed measure was assessed at all four measurement time.

##Measure3 - Timed up and go
Mobility and balance were evaluated by assessing how much time it took for a participant seated on a chair to rise from the chair, walk 3 m at a comfortable and safe pace, return to the chair, and sit down. Timing started at the signal to rise, and stopped when the participant was reseated. Our TUG measure was assessed at all four measurement time.
