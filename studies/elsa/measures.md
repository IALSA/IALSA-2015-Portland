Study_Name contained the following measures, as described by the study's documentation. [text](http://)


##Grip

**grip** -  Participants were instructed to hold a hand grip for two or three seconds. Three measurements were taken from each hand. Data for grip is available for wave two, four, six.


##Walking Speed

**walking speed** - To assess walking speed, participants were asked to walk a distance of eight feet at their usual pace. Use of walking aids was permitted in the test. Only participants who could complete the task on their own or who were not in danger of falling were asked to take the test. The task was completed twice and the mean of the two measurements was calculated. Data for walking speed is available from wave one to six. 


##Leg Raise Test

**leg raise test** - The participants were instructed to stand on one leg and lift the other leg as long as possible for a maximum of 30 seconds. The participants were asked to keep their eyes open during the task. Participants who were able to complete the first task were instructed to complete the same task with their eyes closed. Data for the leg raise test is available for wave two, four, six.

##Balance Test

**balance test** - First, the participants were instructed to complete the side by side tandem task of standing with their feet together, side-by-side, for about 10 seconds. Participants who were able to complete this first task were instructed to complete the semi tandem task of standing with the side of the heel of one foot touching the big toe of the other foot for about 10 seconds. Participants who were able to complete this task, were asked to move on to the full tandem task of standing with the heel of one foot in front of and touching the toes of the other foot for about 10 or 30 seconds. Data for balance is available for wave two, four, six.

##Chair Rise 

**chair rise** - Participants were instructed to stand up from a chair with their arms across their chest. Participants who completed this first task were instructed to stand up and sit as quickly as possible for 5 or 10 times without stopping in between and without using their arms. Data for chair rise is available for wave two, four, six.

##Forced Expiratory Volume 

**FEV** - The volume in litres expelled in the first second of a forced expiration was measured in litres. A Spirometer (Vitalograph Micro) was used. Three measurements were taken and the highest score was used as the valid value. High values indicate better lung function. Data for FEV is available for wave two, four, six.

##Forced Vital Capacity

**FVC** -  The full volume expelled following a maximum inspiration was measured in litres. A Spirometer (Vitalograph Micro) was used. Three measurements were taken and the highest score was used as the valid value. High values indicate better lung function. Data for FVC is available for wave two, four, six.

##Peak Expiratory Flow

**PEF** - The fastest rate of exhalation recorded in litres per minute. A Spirometer (Vitalograph Micro) was used. Three measurements were taken and the highest score was used as the valid value. High values indicate better lung function. PEF is only available at wave 6.
