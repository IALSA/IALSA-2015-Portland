Logging the progress on RADC analyises[.](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/edit/master/studies/radc/descriptives/README.md)  


##Add content
RADC has 20 waves of follow-up data. 
Only the first 5 waves were included in the grip, pulmonary, and walking models that are part of the bivariate ISR table because that was the number of waves that could be included for all physical outcomes for both men and women without dropping the covariance coverage. 

Currently exploring results with more waves of data included by specifying covariance coverage as .05. So far it extending the waves included does change the significance of the results.
