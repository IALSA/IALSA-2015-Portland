Study_Name contained the following measures, as described by the study's documentation. [text](http://)

##Grip

**grip** -  Grip strength was measured using the Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument, Lafayette, Ind., USA) (Bennett et al., 2005; Buchman, Wilson, Bienias, & Bennett, 2005). Two trials of grip strength were obtained for each hand. A composite measure of grip strength was calculated from the average of the four trials. 

##Pulmonary function

**Pulmonary function** - Pulmonary function was tested using a hand-held spirometry (MicroPlus Spirometer MS03, MicroMedical Ltd.) which gives measures of forced expiratory volume (liters in one second), forced vital capacity (liters), and peak expiratory flow (liters/second). This device has been validated to American Thoracic Society standards and has been previously used in large epidemiological studies of respiratory function (Bennett et al., 2005). Measures of maximal inspiratory pressure (cm H2O) and maximal expiratory pressure (cm H2O) were taken using a hand-held device containing a pressure-sensitive transducer (MicroMouth Pressure Meter MP01; MicroMedical Ltd.). These are measures of respiratory muscle strength. 

##Walking Speed

**walking speed** - Gait speed was measured as the amount of time taken to walk 8 feet. Participants were instructed to walk at a normal pace and given two trials (Bennett et al., 2005).
