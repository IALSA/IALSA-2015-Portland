- [Catalog](./catalog.md) shows studies and outcomes
- [Timetable](./timetable.md)  shows deadlines and progress
- Collaboraion will be traced by a collection of [github issues](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/milestones/PxP%20-%20Physical)   
- The features of the workflow will be organized in accordance to the  [github labels](../github_labels.md), you can think of them as virtual sub-teams, or departments that are handling a particular type of problems.  To help with the workflow, here's a rough mapping of current participants into [teams](../physical/teams.md). This mapping is not a allocation of merit, but rather a distribution of responsibilities among the participants. This also communicates to the rest of the research community who should be contacted for what expertise on the project.
