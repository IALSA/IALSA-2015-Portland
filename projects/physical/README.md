Project description

## Resources for the **physical** project

Table 1 identifies physical outcomes that were used in statistical models by each participating study.

Table 1. Phystical outcomes in participating studies.

| |study/outcome   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| 
|ELSA   | grip |  | fev  |    |   |   | 
|HRS    | grip  | gait  |   | pek  |   |   | 
|OCTO   | grip  | gait  |   | pek  |   |   | 
|RADC   | grip  | gait  | fev  |   |   |   | 


Note: Should we allow studies in with only 2 outcome? Is it still worth it?


This table suggest the following roadmap for running bivariate models.

|outcome pair   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| grip-gait   |   | HRS  | OCTO   | RADC  |
| grip-fev  | ELSA   |   |   | RADC  |
| grip-pek  |   | HRS  | OCTO|   |
| gait-fev  |   |   |   | RADC   |
| gait-pek  |   |HRS  | OCTO  |   |
| fev-pek  |   |   |   |   |
