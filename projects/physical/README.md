- [Catalog](./catalog.md) shows studies and outcomes
- [table](./timetable.md)  shows deadlines and progress
- Collaboraion will be traced by a collection of [github issues](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/milestones/PxP%20-%20Physical)   
- The features of the workflow will be organized in accordance to the  [github labels](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/blob/master/projects/github_labels.md), you can think of them as virtual sub-teams, or departments that are handling a particular type of problems. I"m assinging these four labels with specific meaning ( described [here](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/blob/master/projects/github_labels.md), but other labels are available [too](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/labels)
