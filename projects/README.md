## Planned Projects

###1.Pulmonary
*PLEASE ADD ONE PARAGRAPH OF DESCRIPTION*  
Association between changes in [**pulmonary**](./pulmonary/README.md) function and changes in cognitive function

###2.Grip
*PLEASE ADD ONE PARAGRAPH OF DESCRIPTION*  
Association between changes in [**grip**](./grip/README.md) strength and changes in cognitive function    

###3.Gait
*PLEASE ADD ONE PARAGRAPH OF DESCRIPTION*  
Association between changes in [**gait**](./gait/README.md) and changes in cognitive function  

###4.Cognitive
*PLEASE ADD ONE PARAGRAPH OF DESCRIPTION*  
Associations between [**cognitive**](./cognitive/README.md) variables, within and across domains  

###5.Physical
Associations among rates of change in [**physical**](./physical/README.md) capability variables. 

###6.Physical-cognitive
Association among rates of change in models pair one physical and one cognitive concurrent measurements in a longitudinal model of bivariate linear change. 



##Manuscripts in Development
- [Portland-physical-cognitive](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive) repo follow the physical-cognitive track, evaluating the longitudinal models in which physical and cognitive outcomes form a bivariate linear structure.
