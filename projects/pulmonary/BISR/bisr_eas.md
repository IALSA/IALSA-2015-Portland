The following is the verbal interpretation of graphs that list correlations between three elements of the bivariate (B) growth model: intercepts(I), slopes (S), and residuals(R). See [model specification](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/blob/master/reports/model_specification/README.md) for details. Access BISR graphs on the main [dashboard](http://shiny.ouhsc.edu/IALSA-2015-Portland/shiny/dashboard).
