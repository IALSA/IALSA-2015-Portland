### Abstract

> The Integrative Analysis of Longitudinal Studies of Aging and Dementia (IALSA) network is comprised of nearly 100 longitudinal studies of aging, health, and dementia. While harmonization and coordinated analysis (Hofer & Piccinin, 2009; Hofer & Piccinin, 2010) enable replication and extension of research findings across independent studies, the challenges of organizing and efficiently carrying out such analyses and cross-study synthesis remain pressing. A single multi-study project may require to estimate, process, organize, and interpreted hundreds if not thousands of statistical models to be weaved into a single narrative. Analyses of this scale demands novel instruments. Using social coding platform GitHub and custom scripts in R language, we utilize a flexible system of dynamic reports aggregating the results of models from all participating studies, with a possibility of updates in real time. We demonstrate this “big analysis” approach by examining data from seven longitudinal studies with a small group of statistical models (e.g. multilevel model with random intercepts and random linear slopes) that explore multivariate associations among rates of change in physical and cognitive abilities.
