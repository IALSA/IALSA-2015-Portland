A Collaborative Modeling Framework for Multi-Study Coordinated Analyses
========================================================
Andriy Koval, University of Victoria

[IALSA network](http://ialsa.org)

July-22-2015, *Wellcome Trust Conference*

Portland Workshop
======
-  examine associations between changes in **physical** functioning
 (i.e., grip strength, pulmonary function, chair stands, walking speed)
-  and **cognitive** functioning (i.e., measures of speed, memory, reasoning, executive functioning)
- in **multiple-study** comparative framework using
- **bivariate growth models**


Publication Model
======
![pub](test.png)
## Association between changes in
- [**pulmonary**](./projects/pulmonary/README.md), [**grip**](./projects/grip/README.md),  [**gait**](./projects/gait/README.md) and cognitive functioning
- [**cognitive**](./projects/cognitive/README.md) variables,  [**physical**](./projects/physical/README.md) variables

Open Science & Reproducible Research
====

- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland)
- no data is shared, only models
- all scripts and reports available online
- 1649 models submitted so far
![counts_table](counts_table.png)


Dashboard
===
![dashboard](dashboard.png)
- built with ```shinydashboard``` R package
- interactive html interface on top of R script
- what exactly do those number count?

About: Model ID
===
![naming](model_naming_convention.png)

- each file with model output provided a unique model ID
- ID is parsed into variables we can use in meta-analysis over studies

About: Domain Mapping
====
- constructs/domains are flexible
- here is our current organization
- first six characters, counts
![domain map](domain_map-1.png)


Model Collective
====
 - counts models in each combination
 - each color adds to 100%
 - pivot table
  - study_name: EAS
  - physical_measure: grip
  - model_type: aeh
  - list unique values
  - pc_CORR_11
 - what are the key info about the model that we want to collect?  (ISR)

Specification
===
- random intercepts, slopes, residuals (ISR)
- Bivariate ISR (BISR) graph



BISR
===
- view for one study and one physical measure
- variance, p-value, 95CIs
Compare
- (EAS, grip, aeh) vs. (EAS, grip, a)
- (EAS, grip, aeh) vs. (OCTO, grip, aeh)

Forest
===

Compare
- view for all studies with this physical measure
- block : (eas,males) vs. (octo, females)
- mmse : (octo, males) vs. (oct, females)


Future
===
 - [IalsaSynthesis](https://github.com/IALSA/IalsaSynthesis/blob/master/README.md) - R package to service collaborative workshops
 - add data : new **models**
 - add data : new **studies**
 - add data : new **outcomes**
 - add models: new **specifications**
 - add questions: new **analyses**
