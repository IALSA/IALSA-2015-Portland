#Concurrent decline of body and mind  

IALSA-2015-Portland workshop performs a **coordinated analysis with replication (CAR)** of concomitant decline of physical and cognitive functioning during later adulthood.  

The following fou4 graphs cross-tab the **counts** of submitted models with *Cognitive Measures*:   

 [![model space 5D](./reports/model_space/figure_modelSpace5D/dashboard_tile_graph-1.png)](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/blob/master/reports/model_space/Model-Space-5D.md)  
The numbers in the cells count models of that specification. Each color adds up to 100%. "univar" indicates univariate growth models fitting either cognitive or physical process. Submitted models vary in respect to their:  
 - ```study_name``` - (*e.g.* eas, satsa)  in which it was estimated  
 - ```model_number```: (u0, u1, u2, b0, b1, b2) alphanumeric of model form (u,b) and shape (int0rcept, s1ope, qua2radic )   
 - ```subgroup```: (female, male) subsets on which models are estimated    
 - ```model_type```: (0, a, ae, aeh, aehplus, full), a.k.a. *CovSet*, *Predictor Set* 
 - ```physical_measure``` - (*e.g.*  grip, gait, pek)    
 - ```cognitive_measure``` - (*e.g.*  block, digits, animals)   

 
Any model counted in the above graph can be specified with a form nested within the general **specification**:  
[![general_model_specification](./libs/images/general_model_specification.png)](./reports/model_specification/README.md)  
</br>
The **covariance structure** will be given as

For  details see [model specification](./reports/model_specification/README.md).  


## Tools  
Analytic tools available to the workshop participants include dynamic **reports** and interactive **apps**. Both reports and apps are regenerated with each new influx of model submissions.  

### Reports 
 - [Rename and collapse](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/blob/master/reports/rename_collapse/Track_renaming.md)  gives account of how model filename elements (subgroup, model_type, cognitive_measure, etc.) are corrected, renamed, and reclassified. Incorporates the results of Teleconference 1 on Jun 12.    
 - [Model Counts](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/blob/master/reports/basic/counts.html)  and  [Model Essentials](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/blob/master/reports/basic/essentials.html)  give basic tabled view of data in model space.

 - [model_space](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/blob/master/reports/model_space/README.md) is a series of reports that tries to understand how best to organize our models for the analysis, in which model (not individual) is the primary unit .   
 - [reproduce](./scripts/utility/reproduce.R) script that re-generates all these reports.   
 - [scripts README](./scripts/README.md) overview scripts that replicates data preparation  
 
### Apps  
 - [dashboard](http://shiny.ouhsc.edu/IALSA-2015-Portland/shiny/dashboard)  
 - [pivot tables](http://shiny.ouhsc.edu/IALSA-2015-Portland/shiny/pivotTable) for basic exploration in the space of the submitted models

### Background

The current repository analyzes the results of the IALSA Analysis Workshop ([pdf overview](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a8zmh70ybedyec6/IALSA%20Feb%202015%20Workshop%20Overview.pdf?dl=0)) that was  held in Portland, Oregon from Monday February 23rd (8:30am) to Wednesday February 25th (12:30pm), 2015. 

The primary aim of the workshop was to examine associations between changes in physical functioning (i.e., grip strength, pulmonary function, chair stands, walking speed) and cognitive functioning (i.e., measures of speed, memory, reasoning, executive functioning) in multiple-study comparative framework. Bivariate growth processes were estimated to evaluate dynamic associations in change and variation within and across these domains and in relation to sample and individual differences in age, lifestyle, and health outcomes. The results from these analyses will extend recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses (e.g., [Clouston et al., 2012, Epidemiological Reviews](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vfe7u2ez5oxp3ev/Clouston_2013_Epidemiol%20Rev.pdf?dl=0) and will be submitted for publication as a set of independent brief reports, capped by a literature review/overview of analysis and completed with a research synthesis summary.

## Projects

Our current goals include publication of papers investigating the following fi5e associations:  

- Association between changes in [**pulmonary**](./projects/pulmonary/README.md) function and changes in cognitive function
- Association between changes in [**grip**](./projects/grip/README.md) strength and changes in cognitive function    
- Association between changes in [**gait**](./projects/gait/README.md) and changes in cognitive function  
- Associations between [**physical-cognitive**](./projects/physical-cognitive/README.md) variables, within and across domains  
- Associations among rates of change in [**physical**](./projects/physical/README.md) capability variables 

See [projects](./projects/README.md) page for a detailed overview of these five projects.
