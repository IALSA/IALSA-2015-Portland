#### Coordinated analysis with replication (CAR)
#### Concomitant change in physical and cognitive functioning

-  [Model Counts](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/blob/master/reports/counts.html) reports combinations of physical and cognitive constructs/measures in bivariate models of change available in the workshop collective to date. 


- [Model Essentials](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/blob/master/reports/essentials.html) reports correlations between random terms (intercepts, slopes, residuals) of bivariate models of change.

#### Catalog of names  
  Different studies may have the data for the same measures, but modelers may name them differently in their models, which results in our scripts treating them as different measures. To avoid this, please consult our [Catalog of names](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/blob/master/Catalog of names.md) and make sure that your models reflect the convention established there. Any member of the collective can [edit the catalog](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/edit/master/Catalog of names.md) and we encourage you to do so: this will greatly increase the replicability effect of the project.

## Overview

The IALSA Analysis Workshop ([pdf overview](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a8zmh70ybedyec6/IALSA%20Feb%202015%20Workshop%20Overview.pdf?dl=0)) was  held in Portland, Oregon from Monday February 23rd (8:30am) to Wednesday February 25th (12:30pm), 2015. The primary aim was to examine associations between changes in physical functioning (i.e., grip strength, pulmonary function, chair stands, walking speed) and cognitive functioning (i.e., measures of speed, memory, reasoning, executive functioning) in multiple-study comparative framework. Multivariate analyses will be used to evaluate dynamic associations in change and variation within and across these domains and in relation to sample and individual differences in age, lifestyle, and health outcomes. The results from these analyses will extend recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses (e.g., [Clouston et al., 2012, Epidemiological Reviews](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vfe7u2ez5oxp3ev/Clouston_2013_Epidemiol%20Rev.pdf?dl=0) and will be submitted for publication as a set of independent brief reports, capped by a literature review/overview of analysis and completed with a research synthesis summary.

## Analysis Projects: 
Results will be organized into several "multivariate change" publication sets including
* Pulmonary Function/Cognition
* Walking Speed/Cognition
* Grip Strength/Cognition
* All Physical
* All Cognitive
