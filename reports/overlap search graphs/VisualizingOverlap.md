This report establishes four key graphs that go into compiling the Model Catalog, which will be used to find and view replicated models. 



```
Source: local data frame [2 x 2]

  converged    n
1     FALSE    1
2      TRUE 1063
```


## Prototype

These four graphs can be united into a display of a quantitative invormation, necessary to identify overlaps in models across studies.
