<!-- Frequency counts   -->

This report tabulates frequency counts of bivariate models that are available in the workshop collective at the current time. For correlations between random terms in bivariate models consult [Model Essentials](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/blob/master/reports/essentials.html)

## Overview

We are yet to receive model results from the following studies:  
```{r missing_studies, echo=echoChunks, results='asis', message=FALSE}
```


Presently, the **total number of legally named models** supplied by the participating studies is
```{r number_studies, echo=echoChunks, results='asis', message=FALSE}
```
: they include both *bivariate* and *univariate* models. Strings *"nophys"* and *"nocog"*, imply that the model is univariate (e.i. nocog == The particular cog predictor is "none")

<!-- Frequency counts   -->
Counting valid models in each study:
```{r freq_studies, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

However, for the present time, we will focus only on 
```{r number_studies_filtered, echo=echoChunks, results='asis', message=FALSE}
```
linear models.
```{r freq_studies_filter, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

**LINEAR  MODELS (u1, b1) ONLY BEYOND THIS POINT**

# Physical Domain

## Constructs 

Number of models that use the following **Physical contructs**
```{r freq_phys_constructs_studies, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

## Measures

Number of models that use the following **Physical measures**
```{r freq_phys_measures_studies, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

## Measures by Constructs

Number of models using this **measure** of the  physical **construct**
```{r freq_phys_measures_phys_construct, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

## Measures by Constructs and Studies

Number of models using this **measure** of the  physical **construct**, by study
```{r freq_phys_measures_phys_construct_studies, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```


# Cognitive Domain

## Constructs 

Number of models that use the following **Cognitive contructs**
```{r freq_cog_constructs_studies, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

## Measures

Number of models that use the following **Cognitive measures**
```{r freq_cog_measures_studies, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}

# Bivariate models

## Cross Constructs

Number of models that uses this **physical construct** (column) and  **cognitive construct** (row):
```{r freq_cog_construct_phys_construct, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```
It is important to remember that these numbers reflect only the combinations of **constructs**, the  **operationalizations** of these construct (specifc outcomes) that may differ from model to model. 

## Cross Measures

Number of models that uses this **physical measure** (column) and  **cognitive measure** (row):
```{r freq_cog_measure_phys_measure, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

## Cross Measures (fill)

```{r freq_cog_measure_phys_measure_studies_allnames, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```


## Cross Measures by Study

```{r freq_cog_measure_phys_measure_studies, echo=echoChunks, results='asis', message=FALSE}
```

For the sake of documentation and reproducibility, the current report was rendered on a system using the following software.

```{r session_info, echo=FALSE}
