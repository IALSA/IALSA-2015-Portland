the folder `./reports/effects-random` contains tables and graphs reporting the random mixed effects for growth models for each study.  This supports "Table 2" in the planned manuscripts. 

A growth model is conceptualized as four elements: intercept of process A, slope of process A, intercept of process B, slope of process B.
