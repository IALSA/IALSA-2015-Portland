The folder `./reports/growth-curve1` contains zzz 

A growth curve is conceptualized as a trajectory of a measure in time (process), quantified by components that define the multilevel line: intercept, slope, and covariate loadings. Within each study, a process can be paired with other processes in bivariate growth curve model. We are interested in understanding how a process (collection of parameters that build a line) varies across differnt statistical "contexts". The general shape of the line should be similar across contexts, so radically differnt solutions are alarming and require further investigation.

one table = one measure (bnt)
one table = one subgroup (female)
one table = one model_type (aehplus)
one table = one index type (est), subsets Selector

row = model (involving a measure of reference)
column =  estimated values of model elements (e.g. a_GAMMA_01), (est)
