# Catalog for common variable names

Please abide by the following naming rules  
  - must be spelled as one word   
  - must be descriptive of the test, at the same time  
  - try to make is as short as possible, but  
  - avoid abbreviation, unless it's very common (mmse, wais)   
  - try no to make it too long  
  
X - Suspected overlap. Inspect closer to detect overlaps  
NA - Study has been inspected in regards to a suspected overlap and no applicable varialbes/measures have been found.
" " - empty space implies no information is availible yet

### What to do

1) find places where to put more Xs  
2) investigate each X to make into a variable name (how it's spelled in that study) or NA  
3) establish the equivalency by creating a common name
